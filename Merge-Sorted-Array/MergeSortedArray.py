    You are given two integer arrays nums1 and nums2, sorted in non-decreasing order, and two integers m and n, representing the number of elements in nums1 and nums2 respectively.
    Merge nums1 and nums2 into a single array sorted in non-decreasing order.
    The final sorted array should not be returned by the function, but instead be stored inside the array nums1. To accommodate this, nums1 has a length of m + n, where the first m elements denote the elements that should be merged, and the last n elements are set to 0 and should be ignored. nums2 has a length of n.
    
    18:19 Initialize two pointers that point to the last data elements in both arrays.
    20 Initialize a third pointer that points to the last index of num1.
    21:29 Traverse nums1 from the end using the third pointer and compare the values corresponding to the first two pointers.
    :: Place the larger of the two values at the third pointerâ€™s index.
    :: Repeat the process until the two arrays are merged.
