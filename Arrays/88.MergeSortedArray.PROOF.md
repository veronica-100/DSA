    18:19 Initialize two pointers that point to the last data elements in both arrays.
    20 Initialize a third pointer that points to the last index of num1.
    21:29 Traverse nums1 from the end using the third pointer and compare the values corresponding to the first two pointers.
    :: Place the larger of the two values at the third pointerâ€™s index.
    :: Repeat the process until the two arrays are merged.
